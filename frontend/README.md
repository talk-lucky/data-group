# Frontend

This directory contains the Vue.js frontend application.

It was initialized manually due to issues with scaffolding tools in the environment.

To run this application:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run serve` (or `npm run dev` if using Vite - check `package.json`) to start the development server.
